== Paul Catala

I am an associate professor (maître de conférences) at CRAN (Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy) and Université de Lorraine, part of the [cran-simul.github.io SiMul] and [www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/departements/biosis/photodiag/ PhotoDiag] teams. I work on optimisation, moment-SoS hierarchies and optimal transport applied to inverse problems in image processing. 

# I am a postdoctoral researcher at Helmholtz Munich and TUM, working in the groups of Frank Filbir and [https://www.professoren.tum.de/krahmer-felix Felix Krahmer] on inverse problems in imaging.

# Prior to that I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Osnabrück, working on the reconstruction of measures from moments with [https://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/index.php?id=1948 Stefan Kunis].

# I did my PhD at ENS and Inria Paris (in the [https://team.inria.fr/mokaplan/ Mokaplan] team), under the supervision of [http://www.gpeyre.com/ Gabriel Peyré] and [https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Vincent.Duval/ Vincent Duval]. My PhD aimed at developing efficient off-the-grid algorithms for inverse problems in imaging, which involved in particular continuous sparse optimization, moment-SoS hierarchies and Fourier analysis.
