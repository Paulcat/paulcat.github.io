== Paul Catala
I am a post-doctoral student at University of Osnabrück, working on the reconstruction of measures from moments with [https://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/index.php?id=1948 Stefan Kunis].

I did my PhD at ENS and Inria Paris (in the [https://team.inria.fr/mokaplan/ Mokaplan] team), under the supervision of [http://www.gpeyre.com/ Gabriel Peyré] and [https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Vincent.Duval/ Vincent Duval]. My PhD aimed at developing efficient off-the-grid algorithms for inverse problems in imaging, which involved in particular continuous sparse optimization, moment-SoS hierarchies and Fourier analysis.

The manuscript of my thesis may be found [https://paulcat.github.io/files/Thesis_PaulCatala.pdf here]
